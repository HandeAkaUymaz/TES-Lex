This repository contains the Turkish Emotion and Sentiment Lexicon (TES-Lex) introduced in our study:

"Exploring the Effectiveness of LLM-Generated Context on Emotion Lexicon Word Vectorization: A Comparative Study on Turkish and English" Senem Kumova Metin, Hande Aka Uymaz

## 🔍 Overview
TES-Lex is a manually annotated lexicon for the Turkish language, containing 20,121 emotion and sentiment words. It was created to support emotion and sentiment detection tasks in Turkish, a relatively low-resourced language in natural language processing (NLP) studies.

Each word in the lexicon includes:

Up to two emotion labels based on Plutchik’s 8 emotions: Anger, Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, Surprise, Anticipation, Trust.

Emotion intensity scores (scale 1-5)

Sentiment polarity (Positive / Negative / Neutral)

Polarity intensity (None, Slight, Moderate, High)

The annotations were conducted by three native Turkish speakers and finalized using majority voting.

Please refer to the paper for more details on the annotation methodology and experimental setup.
